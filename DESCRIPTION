Description: Implements the t-walk algorithm, a general-purpose, self-adjusting
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for continuous distributions as
    described by Christen & Fox (2010) <doi:10.1214/10-BA603>. The t-walk requires
    no tuning and is robust for a wide range of target distributions, including
    high-dimensional and multimodal problems. This implementation includes an
    option for running multiple chains in parallel to accelerate sampling and
    facilitate convergence diagnostics.
